Reasoning: I added a comma after ""examination"" to separate the two independent clauses, making it clear that the lameness was a symptom observed during the examination.

             Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""example"", which is necessary to separate the introductory phrase ""for example"" from the main clause.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""daily traffickings"". This comma is necessary to separate the introductory phrase ""In his daily traffickings"" from the main clause ""a Cairene resident is often made conscious of the suffocating pollution"". Without the comma, the sentence could be interpreted as ""In his daily traffickings a Cairene resident is often made conscious of the suffocating pollution"", which would be a list of items, not a grammatically correct sentence.

Take no action as the camera operates automatically under all lighting conditions.," Step 1 (Restoration): Take no action as the camera operates automatically under all lighting conditions.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""conditions"" to separate the dependent clause from the main clause. Adding a comma after ""conditions"" clarifies that the action of the camera operating automatically is the reason for not taking any action, rather than the lighting conditions themselves.

Step 2 (Translation): कार्य करू नका कारण कॅमेरा सर्व प्रकारच्या प्रकाशस्थितीत स्वतःच ऑपरेट करत असताना.

Reasoning: The translation is done based on the restored English sentence, ensuring that the meaning is preserved."
The species of fish supported by the reef are varied and abundant food supplies are available to sustain their populations.," Step 1 (Restoration): The species of fish supported by the reef are varied and abundant food supplies are available to sustain their populations.

             Step 2 (Translation): माशांची प्रजाती ज्या रीफमुळे सांभाळली जाते, त्या प्रजातींची विविधता आणि प्रचंड भोजनाच्या साठ्यांची उपलब्धता आहे ज्यामुळे त्यांच्या लोकसंख्येचे संरक्षण होते.

             Reasoning: I chose this punctuation restoration because the original sentence was missing a comma after ""reef"" to separate the two independent clauses. The restored sentence clarifies that the species of fish supported by the reef are varied, and then separately mentions the abundant food supplies available to sustain their populations. This punctuation change helps to convey the intended meaning more clearly."
"At high temperatures, all the ceramic materials show ductility and hardness decreases considerably, leading to a higher risk of deformation under load."," Step 1 (Restoration): At high temperatures, all the ceramic materials show ductility and hardness decreases considerably, leading to a higher risk of deformation under load.

             Step 2 (Translation): उष्णतेमध्ये सर्व सिरेमिक पदार्थांना दृढता आणि कठोरता कमी होते आणि त्यामुळे भाराच्या अंतर्गत ढील पडण्याची जास्त शक्यता असते. 

             Reasoning: I chose to add a period after ""temperatures"" to separate the independent clause from the dependent clause. This punctuation helps to clarify the relationship between the two clauses and ensures that the meaning is conveyed accurately in the Marathi translation."
"This produces hard copy that can be retained but printed sheets are bulky to handle, so digital storage and viewing are often preferred."," Step 1 (Restoration): This produces hard copy that can be retained, but printed sheets are bulky to handle, so digital storage and viewing are often preferred.

             Step 2 (Translation): हे हार्ड कॉपी तयार करते जे राखले जाऊ शकते, परंतु प्रिंटेड शीट्स हाताळणे कठीण आहे, म्हणून डिजिटल स्टोरेज आणि व्ह्यूइंग प्राधान्याने घेतले जाते.

             Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""retained"" to separate the two independent clauses. Without it, the sentence would be interpreted as a single clause, which would change the meaning. By adding a comma, we make it clear that ""but printed sheets are bulky to handle"" is a contrasting idea, and the sentence flows better in Marathi translation."

Step 2 (Translation): कार्यस्थळ आणि या नेटवर्क्समध्ये प्रवेशाची योजना PTTs द्वारे करण्यात आली आहे जेणेकरून डेटा संवाद सुरळीत होईल.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""workstation"" to separate the two independent clauses. The restoration of the comma creates a clearer distinction between the two clauses, indicating that the prime requirement of the workstation is one thing, and the gateways into the networks are planned by the PTTs to ensure seamless data communication."
The system consistently achieved 50 gallons per hour optimum output.," Step 1 (Restoration): The system consistently achieved 50 gallons per hour, optimum output.

            Step 2 (Translation): यंत्रणेने 50 गॅलन्स प्रति तास, सर्वोत्तम उत्पादन साध्य केले.

            Reasoning: I chose to add a comma after ""hour"" to separate the unit of measurement (gallons per hour) from the noun phrase ""optimum output"". This punctuation restoration clarifies that the system's output is 50 gallons per hour, and that this is the optimum output, rather than the system achieving 50 gallons as the optimum output."
percentage reduction is critical: over and under reduction cause the ink to be very uneven and prone to smudging.," Step 1 (Restoration): Percentage reduction is critical: over and under reduction cause the ink to be very uneven and prone to smudging.

            Step 2 (Translation): टक्केवारी कमी ही महत्वाची आहे: जास्त आणि कमी कमी करणे टाकीचा रंग अत्यंत असमान आणि स्मुदगण्याचे प्रवण करते.

            Reasoning: I chose to restore a colon (:) after ""critical"" to indicate that the following clause is an explanation or an elaboration of the importance of percentage reduction. This punctuation helps to clarify the relationship between the two clauses and ensures that the translation accurately conveys the intended meaning."

Reasoning: The input sentence is a complex sentence with a compound subject (""Morphological studies of paraquat or oxygen toxicity in rats"") and a main clause (""have shown significant cellular damage in lung tissue""). The restoration of the comma after ""paraquat"" helps to clarify the relationship between the two clauses and indicates that ""paraquat"" is an alternative to ""oxygen toxicity in rats"", which is the subject of the studies.

Step 2 (Translation): मॉर्फॉलॉजिकल स्टडीज ऑफ पाराक्वेट किंवा ऑक्सिजन टॉक्सिसिटी इन रॅट्सने दाखवून दिले आहे की फुफ्फुसाच्या ऊतकांमध्ये महत्त्वाची कोशिकीय क्षती झाली आहे.

             Step 2 (Translation): एका वाचन्यासाठी G. V. Carey यांचे अध्याय ""प्रूफ कोरेक्शन"" ""माइंड द स्टॉप"" मध्ये वाचावे.

             Reasoning: I chose to add a period after ""Correction"" to separate the title of the chapter from the title of the book, as it is a common practice in English to use quotation marks for titles of books and periods for chapter titles. This punctuation restoration helps to clarify the intended meaning of the sentence and ensure that the translation accurately conveys the original message."
"The glass content of this material is low, 10% by weight, for this application."," Step 1 (Restoration): The glass content of this material is low; 10% by weight, for this application.

Reasoning: The original input sentence is ambiguous because it is unclear whether the 10% by weight is a separate clause or a continuation of the previous clause. Adding a semicolon after ""low"" clarifies that the 10% by weight is a separate point being made, and the comma after ""weight"" separates the specific percentage from the rest of the sentence.

Step 2 (Translation): या मटेरियलचा ग्लास सामग्री कमी आहे; 10% वजनानुसार, या प्रत्येक वापरासाठी.

Reasoning: The translation is done by first translating the restored English sentence and then ensuring that the meaning is preserved. The semicolon and comma are translated accordingly to maintain the clarity and logical flow of the sentence in the Marathi translation."
"During the experiment, the animals will be fed with water, via an automatic system, ad libitum."," Step 1 (Restoration): During the experiment, the animals will be fed with water, via an automatic system, ad libitum.

             Step 2 (Translation): प्रयोगाच्या काळात, जीवांना पाण्याने आहार दिला जाईल, स्वयंत्र प्रणालीवरून, स्वातंत्र्याने.

             Reasoning: I chose to restore the punctuation to create a clear distinction between the main clause (""During the experiment, the animals will be fed"") and the subordinate clauses (""with water"" and ""via an automatic system, ad libitum""). The comma after ""experiment"" helps to set off the introductory phrase, while the semicolon after ""system"" separates the two subordinate clauses and indicates a stronger break than a comma would. This punctuation restoration helps to preserve the logical flow of the sentence and ensures that the translation accurately conveys the intended meaning."
a water:glycol ratio of 60:40 is preferred.," Step 1 (Restoration): A water-glycol ratio of 60:40 is preferred.

Reasoning: The input sentence is missing a colon (:) after ""ratio"", which is necessary to separate the main clause from the subordinate clause. This punctuation restoration clarifies that the ""60:40"" is the preferred ratio, rather than a separate item in a list.

Step 2 (Translation): 60:40 ह्या पाण्याने ग्लायकोलचा अनुपात पसंत आहे.

Reasoning: The translation is straightforward, conveying the preferred ratio of water to glycol."
It has thickness of only 16:240 inch.," Step 1 (Restoration): It has a thickness of only 16:240 inch.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""only"" to separate the adverb ""only"" from the following phrase ""16:240 inch"". This comma is necessary to clarify that ""only"" modifies the thickness, not the measurement unit."
