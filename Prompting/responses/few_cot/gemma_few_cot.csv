            प्रार्थनेचा उच्चार करताना, गानागाराने आवाज वाढवला, जेव्हा अभिषेकाचा उच्चार केला.

            Reasoning:  The original sentence lacked a comma after ""chanting,"" leading to ambiguity.  It could be interpreted as the choir chanting *and* raising the volume, or the choir chanting *while* the volume was raised. Adding a comma clarifies that the choir was chanting, and the volume was raised as a separate action by the choir.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""examination"" and before ""showing"". This comma is crucial to clarify the relationship between the two clauses.  The comma separates the introductory phrase (""A six-month-old calf was submitted for examination"") from the main clause (""showing lameness in all four legs""). Without the comma, the sentence could be misinterpreted as suggesting that the lameness was the reason for the examination.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""develops,"" creating ambiguity about whether ""the forms"" were being developed or if the development of the machine was a condition for amending the forms. Adding the comma clarifies the intended meaning, making it clear that the amendment of the forms is dependent on the machine's development.

The semicolon separates two independent clauses that are closely related, while the comma after ""this"" clarifies the beginning of the dependent clause. This punctuation restoration ensures the sentence flows logically and accurately conveys the intended meaning.

            Step 2 (Translation): मला माहितीच्या दृष्टिकोनातून, कोणत्याही वृत्तपत्र पूर्णपणे निष्पक्ष नाही.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""No,"" which creates ambiguity. Adding the comma clarifies that ""No"" is an emphatic negation, meaning ""Not any newspaper"" rather than ""No newspaper is.""  This is crucial for the accurate translation in Marathi. 



"

            Step 2 (Translation): वाष्प, उदाहरणार्थ, त्या पदार्थासाठी अम्ल जितकेच हानीकारक आहे.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""project"" which led to ambiguity.  The comma clarifies that ""established in the desert at high cost"" is a descriptive phrase modifying the ""new project.""  This punctuation ensures the Marathi translation accurately reflects the intended meaning. 


"

            Step 2 (Translation): सर्व पूर्व प्रयत्नांमध्ये अपयश झाल्यावर, तो एक नवीन योजना आखला जी सर्वांनाच आश्चर्यचकित केली.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""attempts,"" creating ambiguity about whether ""he evolved a new plan"" is directly related to the previous clause.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""facilities"" in the first clause. This comma is essential to separate the two contrasting ideas: adequate study facilities and hardly any sports facilities. Without the comma, the sentence could be misinterpreted as saying the school has inadequate facilities for both study and sports.

            Step 2 (Translation):  विशिष्टतेतील महत्त्वाचे शब्द हे आहेत: संकेत आतूनच वाहिले पाहिजेत.

            Reasoning:  The original sentence lacked a colon after ""specification"" and a comma after ""signals.""

"
"What we see, we believe what we hear, we register","Step 1 (Restoration): What we see, we believe; what we hear, we register. 

            Step 2 (Translation): जे पाहतो, त्यावर विश्वास ठेवतो; जे ऐकतो, त्याची नोंद घेतो.

            Reasoning: The original sentence is grammatically incorrect and ambiguous. The comma after ""see"" and ""hear"" are necessary to separate the clauses and show that each clause has its own subject and verb.  Without these commas, the sentence could be interpreted as ""What we see, we believe what we hear, we register"" which is a nonsensical statement. 


"

            The original sentence lacked a comma after ""However"" and before ""oxidative stress occurs."" This comma is crucial because it separates the introductory adverbial phrase (""However"") from the main clause. Without the comma, the sentence could be misinterpreted as saying that oxidative stress is ""however"" itself, which is grammatically incorrect. 


"

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas, leading to ambiguity about the relationship between the clauses. Adding commas after ""ignite"" and ""purge"" clarifies the sequence of events and separates the two independent clauses, resulting in a more grammatically correct and understandable sentence.

            Reasoning: 
            The original sentence lacked commas to separate the clauses and the quoted material. 
            Adding commas after ""child"" and ""maturity"" clarifies the structure and shows that the quoted phrase is a separate thought.

            Reasoning:  The original sentence lacked a comma after ""Unfortunately"" and before ""though,"" creating ambiguity about the relationship between the two clauses. Adding these commas clarifies that ""though"" introduces a contrasting element, making the meaning more coherent.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas to separate the dependent clause (""which have cracks or damaged B-nut fittings"") from the main clause. Adding commas clarifies the relationship between the clauses and ensures the meaning is conveyed accurately. The comma after ""conduits"" also separates the introductory phrase from the main verb phrase, improving readability.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""chamber,"" leading to ambiguity.  The comma clarifies that the phrase ""is larger than the intake valve opening"" modifies the preceding phrase ""the orifice through which the exhaust gases leave the chamber.""  Without the comma, it could be misinterpreted as if the orifice itself is larger than the intake valve.

            Step 2 (Translation):  काहीही कारवाई करू नका, कारण कॅमेरा सर्व प्रकाश परिस्थितीत स्वयंचलितपणे कार्य करते.

            Reasoning: The original sentence is ambiguous because it's unclear if ""as the camera operates automatically"" is a dependent clause modifying ""take no action."" Adding a comma separates the clauses clearly, indicating that the lack of action is a recommendation based on the camera's automatic operation.

"This produces hard copy that can be retained but printed sheets are bulky to handle, so digital storage and viewing are often preferred.","Step 1 (Restoration): This produces hard copy that can be retained, but printed sheets are bulky to handle, so digital storage and viewing are often preferred. 

            Step 2 (Translation):  हे हार्ड कॉपी तयार करते जे राखले जाऊ शकते, पण छापलेले कागदपत्रे हाताळण्यास मोटे असतात, म्हणून डिजिटल संग्रहण आणि पाहणे अनेकदा प्राधान्य दिले जाते.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas to separate the independent clauses and a dependent clause. Adding commas clarifies the structure and shows that ""but printed sheets are bulky to handle"" is a contrasting point to ""that can be retained.""

Connection to PTT-supplied packet-switch networks will be a prime requirement of the workstation and gateways into these networks are planned by the PTTs to ensure seamless data communication.,"Step 1 (Restoration): Connection to PTT-supplied packet-switch networks will be a prime requirement of the workstation, and gateways into these networks are planned by the PTTs to ensure seamless data communication. 

            Step 2 (Translation):  पीटीटी-संचालित पॅकेट-स्विच नेटवर्कशी जोडणे कार्यस्थळाचे प्रमुख आवश्यकता असेल, आणि या नेटवर्कमध्ये प्रवेशद्वारे पीटीटीद्वारे सुसंगत डेटा संवाद सुनिश्चित करण्यासाठी नियोजित आहेत.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas, leading to ambiguity about the relationship between the clauses. Adding a comma after ""workstation"" separates the two independent clauses and clarifies that the gateways are planned by the PTTs to ensure seamless data communication. 


"
The system consistently achieved 50 gallons per hour optimum output.,"Step 1 (Restoration): The system consistently achieved 50 gallons per hour, optimum output. 

            Step 2 (Translation):  सिस्टम ने कमीतकमी ५० गॅलन्स प्रति तास, आदर्श उत्पादन मिळवले.

            Reasoning:  The original sentence lacked a comma after ""hour,"" creating ambiguity about whether ""optimum output"" modifies ""50 gallons per hour"" or the entire phrase ""achieved 50 gallons per hour."" Adding the comma clarifies that ""optimum output"" refers to the overall output achieved, not a specific output per hour. 


"
percentage reduction is critical: over and under reduction cause the ink to be very uneven and prone to smudging.,"Step 1 (Restoration): Percentage reduction is critical; over and under reduction cause the ink to be very uneven and prone to smudging. 

            Step 2 (Translation): टक्केवारी कमी करणे महत्त्वाचे आहे; जास्त किंवा कमी कमी करणेमुळे इंक खूपच असमान आणि स्मजण्यास अत्यंत संवेदनशील बनते.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a semicolon to separate the two independent clauses. The semicolon is used here to create a pause and show that the two clauses are related but distinct. The first clause states a fact (percentage reduction is critical), while the second clause explains why (over and under reduction cause uneven ink). 


"
Adopting a user-centered approach is a realistic strategy in the design of both paper and screen based forms.,"Step 1 (Restoration): Adopting a user-centered approach is a realistic strategy in the design of both paper and screen-based forms. 

            Step 2 (Translation): वापरकर्त्यांना केंद्रित करणारा दृष्टिकोन हा कागद आणि स्क्रीनवर आधारित फॉर्म डिझाइन करण्यात एक यथार्थवादी रणनीती आहे.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a hyphen in ""screen-based,"" which is necessary for clarity.  The hyphen clarifies that ""screen-based"" is a compound adjective modifying ""forms."" Without it, the meaning could be ambiguous. 


"
Morphological studies of paraquat or oxygen toxicity in rats have shown significant cellular damage in lung tissue.,"Step 1 (Restoration): Morphological studies of paraquat or oxygen toxicity in rats have shown significant cellular damage in lung tissue.

            Step 2 (Translation): पॅराक्‍वाट किंवा ऑक्‍सीजन विषाणूंवर प्राण्यांवर केलेल्या आकारशास्त्रीय अभ्यासांमधून फुफ्फुसांच्या ऊतीत मोठा सेल्युलर नुकसान दिसून आले आहे. 

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""paraquat"" which created ambiguity.  It could be interpreted as a single study on both paraquat and oxygen toxicity, or two separate studies. Adding the comma clarifies that there are two separate studies, one on paraquat and one on oxygen toxicity. 



"
One should read G. V. Carey’s chapter Proof Correction in Mind the Stop.,"Step 1 (Restoration): One should read G. V. Carey’s chapter, “Proof Correction,” in *Mind the Stop*.

            Step 2 (Translation):  एकाला जी. व्ही. केरी यांच्या ""प्रूफ करेक्शन"" या अध्यायाचा वाचन करायला हवा, *माइंड द स्टॉप* मध्ये. 

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas to separate the chapter title and the book title. Adding commas clarifies the intended meaning, indicating that ""Proof Correction"" is the title of the chapter within the book *Mind the Stop*. 


"
"The glass content of this material is low, 10% by weight, for this application.","Step 1 (Restoration): The glass content of this material is low, 10% by weight, for this application. 

            Step 2 (Translation): या पदार्थाचे कांच्याचे प्रमाण कमी आहे, वजननुसार १०%, या वापरासाठी.

            Reasoning:  The original sentence lacks a comma after ""low"" which creates ambiguity. The comma is essential to separate the introductory phrase ""The glass content of this material is low"" from the subsequent clause providing the percentage. Without the comma, it might seem like 10% is a description of the material being ""low."" 


"
"During the experiment, the animals will be fed with water, via an automatic system, ad libitum.","Step 1 (Restoration): During the experiment, the animals will be fed with water, via an automatic system, ad libitum. 

            Step 2 (Translation): प्रयोगादरम्यान, प्राण्यांना स्वयंचलित प्रणालीद्वारे, अद-लिबिटम पाणी देण्यात येईल.

            Reasoning:  The comma after ""water"" is essential to separate the phrase ""via an automatic system"" as an additional piece of information about how the water will be delivered.  Without the comma, it could be misinterpreted as ""ad libitum"" being part of the system description. 


"
a water:glycol ratio of 60:40 is preferred.,"Step 1 (Restoration): A water:glycol ratio of 60:40 is preferred. 

            Step 2 (Translation): पाण्याच्या आणि ग्लायकॉलच्या मिश्रणाचा ६०:४०अनुपात आवडतो.

            Reasoning: The colon is used here to separate the two parts of a ratio. Without the colon, the sentence would be grammatically incorrect and unclear. 


"
It has thickness of only 16:240 inch.,"Step 1 (Restoration): It has a thickness of only 16:240 inch. 

            Step 2 (Translation): याची मोटाई फक्त १६:२४० इंच आहे.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a crucial article (""a"") before ""thickness,"" making it grammatically incorrect and semantically ambiguous. Adding ""a"" clarifies that the sentence refers to a specific thickness value.
