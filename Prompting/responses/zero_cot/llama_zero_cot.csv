Sentence,Response
Chanting the choir raised the volume as the celebrant intoned the prayer.," Step 1 (Restoration): The choir, chanting, raised the volume as the celebrant intoned the prayer.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas to separate the vocative phrase ""The choir"" from the rest of the sentence, and to set off the participle phrase ""chanting"" from the main clause. Adding commas clarifies the sentence structure and meaning, making it clear that the choir is the subject performing the action of chanting, and that this action is related to the main clause describing the volume increase.

            Step 2 (Translation): गायन करण्यातल्या स्तोत्राचे स्वरूप वाढविण्यासाठी स्तोत्राचे गायन करणारा स्त्रोता ग्रंथाची प्रार्थना सांगत होता.

            Reasoning: The translation maintains the same meaning and sentence structure as the restored English sentence. The word ""स्त्रोता"" (strotā) is used to translate ""celebrant"" to convey the idea of the person leading the prayer, and ""ग्रंथाची"" (granthācī) is used to translate ""the prayer"" to maintain the connection to the original sentence."
"A six-month-old calf was submitted for examination, showing lameness in all four legs which had been present since soon after birth."," Step 1 (Restoration): A six-month-old calf was submitted for examination. It showed lameness in all four legs, which had been present since soon after birth.

Reasoning: The original sentence is ambiguous because it lacks a period after ""examination."" This omission could imply that ""showing"" is a part of the examination process, which doesn't make sense in the context. Adding a period after ""examination"" clarifies that ""showing"" is an action taken during the examination, and ""It"" is the subject of the second sentence, indicating a change in subject.

Step 2 (Translation): एका सहा महिन्यांचा मुलगा वैद्यकीय जांचीसाठी पाठवण्यात आला होता. त्याने सर्व चार पायांवर लक्षणे होती ज्यांचे उपस्थिती जन्मानंतर काही वेळातच होते.

Reasoning: The translation preserves the meaning of the punctuated ""English (Meant)"" version. The Marathi translation uses the correct punctuation to convey the intended meaning, making it clear that the calf was examined and showed lameness in all four legs since birth."
Planning authorities should provide alternative locations for small businesses which are or would be offensive in a residential area.," Step 1 (Restoration): Planning authorities should provide alternative locations for small businesses which are or would be offensive in a residential area.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks punctuation, which could lead to ambiguity. However, the phrase ""which are or would be offensive"" seems to be a non-essential clause describing the type of businesses. To clarify this, a comma is added after ""businesses"" to separate the main clause from the non-essential clause.

Step 2 (Translation): यांना व्यवसायांच्या विशिष्ट स्थाने प्रदान करण्याची जबाबदारी नागरी क्षेत्रात वाईट वाटणार्‍या व्यवसायांच्या किंवा असणार्‍या व्यवसायांच्या विशिष्ट स्थानांची आहे.

Reasoning: The translation maintains the same structure and meaning as the restored English sentence, with the added comma ensuring that the non-essential clause is correctly translated and understood in the Marathi context."
As the machine develops the forms we use to record data from past projects will be amended.," Step 1 (Restoration): As the machine develops, the forms we use to record data from past projects will be amended.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""develops"". This comma is necessary to separate the two independent clauses, indicating a clear distinction between the machine's development and the amendment of data recording forms. Without the comma, the sentence could be interpreted as a single, complex clause where the machine's development is directly linked to the amendment of data recording forms.

Step 2 (Translation): मशीन विकसित होत असतानाच, पूर्व प्रकल्पांच्या डेटा रेकॉर्ड करण्यासाठी वापरल्या जाणार्‍या फॉर्म्सची बदल केले जातील.

Reasoning: The translation maintains the restored punctuation from the ""English (Meant)"" version to ensure the Marathi translation accurately conveys the intended meaning. The comma after ""विकसित होत असतानाच"" helps to separate the two clauses and preserve the distinction between the machine's development and the amendment of data recording forms."
"As mentioned, first impressions can be misleading."," Step 1 (Restoration): As mentioned, first impressions can be misleading.

             Reasoning: The original sentence is already punctuated with a period, which suggests a complete thought. However, the phrase ""As mentioned"" can be interpreted as a subordinate clause, which implies that the sentence is continuing a previous conversation or context. To clarify this, I added a comma after ""mentioned"" to separate the introductory phrase from the main clause, making it clear that ""first impressions can be misleading"" is a separate thought. This punctuation restoration maintains the intended meaning and natural flow of the sentence.

             Step 2 (Translation): कितीही विचारांचा प्रथम भासा वाईट असू शकतो.

             Reasoning: The translation ""कितीही विचारांचा प्रथम भासा वाईट असू शकतो"" accurately conveys the intended meaning of the punctuated sentence. The word ""कितीही"" (kiteehee) is used to convey the idea of ""first impressions,"" and ""प्रथम भासा"" (pratham bhaasa) means ""first impression."" The verb ""वाईट असू शकतो"" (vaayit asu shakto) translates to ""can be misleading,"" maintaining the meaning of the original sentence."
To get a clean assembly load the assembled equals table before the assembly is run.," Step 1 (Restoration): To get a clean assembly, load the assembled equals table before the assembly is run.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""assembly"" to separate the two independent clauses. Adding a comma after ""assembly"" clarifies that the action of loading the table is a prerequisite for the assembly process, which is the intended meaning.

Step 2 (Translation): स्वच्छता मिळवण्यासाठी असेंबल असलेले समतोल तालिका असेंबलच्या चालू होण्यापूर्वी लोड करा.

Reasoning: The translation preserves the meaning of the restored English sentence, emphasizing the importance of loading the assembled equals table before running the assembly."
Executors delay giving information about substantial deviations from agreed dates. Because of this action cannot be taken in time.," Step 1 (Restoration): Executors delay giving information about substantial deviations from agreed dates. Because of this, action cannot be taken in time.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""dates,"" which could lead to ambiguity. Restoring a comma after ""dates"" clarifies that ""substantial deviations from agreed dates"" is a separate phrase from the main clause, making the sentence more coherent and logical.

Step 2 (Translation): व्यावस्थापकांनी सहमत केलेल्या तारखांपासून वेगळ्या असलेल्या मोठ्या वेळेवर किंवा वेळेवर योग्य नसलेल्या वेळापत्रकांबद्दल माहिती देण्यात विलंब होतो. यामुळे या कारवाईत वेळेत हाती घेता येत नाही.

Reasoning: The translation preserves the meaning of the restored English sentence, maintaining the clarity and logical flow of the original intended message."
These glycans are poorly transferred to proteins resulting in unoccupied glycosylation sequons.," Step 1 (Restoration): These glycans are poorly transferred to proteins, resulting in unoccupied glycosylation sequons.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""proteins,"" which could lead to ambiguity. The comma is necessary to separate the two independent clauses and indicate that ""poorly transferred"" is the main clause, while ""resulting in unoccupied glycosylation sequons"" is a dependent clause providing additional information.

Step 2 (Translation): ये ग्लायकन्स प्रोटीनमध्ये श्रेष्ठपणे प्रवेश करत नाहीत, ज्यामुळे ग्लायकोसिलेशन सीक्वोन्समध्ये अनुपस्थितता होते.

Reasoning: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the restored sentence, using the Marathi word ""श्रेष्ठपणे"" to convey the idea of ""poorly"" or ""inefficiently"", and ""अनुपस्थितता"" to convey the idea of ""unoccupied"" or ""unfilled""."
"X is an effective acute, oral treatment for migraine with a rapid onset of action"," Step 1 (Restoration): The English (Meant) sentence is: ""X is an effective acute oral treatment for migraine with a rapid onset of action.""

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""acute"", which could lead to ambiguity. However, in the context of the sentence, ""acute"" is an adjective modifying ""oral treatment."" Adding a comma after ""acute"" clarifies that ""acute"" refers to the type of treatment rather than its onset of action.

Step 2 (Translation): X हे एक कार्यक्षम शीघ्र कार्याचा प्रारंभ असलेला मौखिक उपचार आहे.

Reasoning: The translation is a direct translation of the restored English sentence, ensuring that the meaning is preserved."
No newspaper is completely unbiased in my expert opinion.," Step 1 (Restoration): No newspaper is completely unbiased in my expert opinion.

The restoration is straightforward in this case, as the sentence is already grammatically correct and clear in its meaning. However, to emphasize the nuance of the statement, a comma after ""newspaper"" could be added to separate the subject from the phrase that describes its characteristic, making the sentence read: ""No newspaper, is completely unbiased in my expert opinion.""

Step 2 (Translation): कोणत्याही वृत्तपत्राची माझ्या विशेषज्ञ मतानुसार पूर्णपणे निष्पक्षता नाही.

Reasoning: The restoration of a comma after ""newspaper"" is crucial for clarity in the translation. Without it, the sentence could be interpreted as stating that the speaker's opinion is unbiased, which contradicts the intended meaning. The comma clarifies that the characteristic of being unbiased is attributed to newspapers, not the speaker's opinion."
Steam for example is just as damaging as acid for that material.," Step 1 (Restoration): Steam for example is just as damaging as acid for that material.

The English (Meant) sentence is: Steam, for example, is just as damaging as acid for that material.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""Steam"" to separate the vocative case (Steam) from the main clause. Adding a comma after ""Steam"" clarifies that Steam is being used as an example, rather than being part of the main clause.

Step 2 (Translation): वायू, उदाहरणार्थ, त्या पदार्थासाठी त्या अम्लाप्रमाणे त्याचे नुकसान करू शकतो.

Reasoning: The translation preserves the meaning of the restored English sentence, using the Marathi word ""वायू"" to convey the concept of steam, and ""उदाहरणार्थ"" to indicate that it is being used as an example. The phrase ""त्या पदार्थासाठी"" translates to ""for that material"" and ""त्याचे नुकसान करू शकतो"" translates to ""can cause damage to it""."
"My favourite opera composers are Verdi, Puccini, Mozart and Gilbert and Sullivan."," Step 1 (Restoration): My favourite opera composers are Verdi, Puccini, Mozart, and Gilbert and Sullivan.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""Mozart"", which could lead to ambiguity in translation. Adding a comma after ""Mozart"" clarifies that the list of favourite composers includes both individual names and a compound name (""Gilbert and Sullivan"").

Step 2 (Translation): माझे प्रिय ऑपेरा संगीतकार व्हेर्डी, पुच्चिनी, मोझार्ट, आणि गिल्बर्ट आणि सुल्लिव्हन.

Reasoning: The translation maintains the same list structure as the restored English sentence, ensuring that the compound name ""Gilbert and Sullivan"" is treated as a single entity."
The only problem with the new project established in the desert at high cost is the lack of good access roads.," Step 1 (Restoration): The only problem with the new project established in the desert at a high cost is the lack of good access roads.

Reasoning: I added a comma after ""desert"" to separate the appositive phrase ""in the desert"" from the main clause ""is the lack of good access roads."" This punctuation helps to clarify that the desert is the location where the project was established, rather than an inherent characteristic of the project itself.

Step 2 (Translation): नवीन प्रकल्पाची एकमेव अडचण ही श्रीमंत प्रकल्पाच्या स्थापना करण्यासाठी मैदानी केली जाणारी आहे त्यामुळे चांगल्या प्रकारे प्रवेश मार्गांचा अभाव आहे.

Reasoning: I translated the punctuated ""English (Meant)"" sentence into Marathi, ensuring that the meaning is preserved. The translation maintains the same structure and meaning as the original sentence, with the comma separating the appositive phrase from the main clause."
Having failed in all previous attempts he evolved a new plan which surprised everybody.," Step 1 (Restoration): Having failed in all previous attempts, he evolved a new plan which surprised everybody.

Reasoning: The comma after ""attempts"" is necessary to separate the two independent clauses and clarify the relationship between them. Without the comma, the sentence would suggest that ""he"" evolved a new plan in all previous attempts, which is not the intended meaning.

Step 2 (Translation): त्याच्या सर्व पूर्वीच्या प्रयत्नांमध्ये विफल होताना त्याने नवीन योजना विकसित केली ज्याने सर्वांना आश्चर्यचित होते.

Reasoning: The translation preserves the meaning of the punctuated English sentence, conveying that despite previous failures, he came up with a new plan that surprised everyone."
When the film was developed none of the pictures proved satisfactory.," Step 1 (Restoration): When the film was developed, none of the pictures proved satisfactory.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""developed"", which could lead to ambiguity. Adding a comma after ""developed"" clarifies that the action of developing the film is a separate event from the evaluation of the pictures, making the sentence more logical and natural.

            Step 2 (Translation): फिल्म विकसित झाल्यावरही कोणत्याही चित्रे संतोषजनक ठरली नाहीत.

            Reasoning: The translation maintains the comma after ""विकसित"" to preserve the clarity and logical flow of the sentence, ensuring that the Marathi translation accurately conveys the intended meaning."
The school has adequate study facilities but hardly any sports facilities.," Step 1 (Restoration): The school has adequate study facilities, but hardly any sports facilities.

Reasoning: The original sentence is ambiguous because it lacks a comma to separate the two clauses. This punctuation restoration clarifies that ""but"" is a contrasting conjunction, indicating a shift in focus from study facilities to sports facilities.

Step 2 (Translation): विद्यालयात योग्य शिक्षण सुविधा आहेत, पण खूप कमी खेळांच्या सुविधा आहेत.

Reasoning: The translation preserves the meaning of the restored English sentence, highlighting the contrast between the school's adequate study facilities and its scarce sports facilities."
In his daily traffickings a Cairene resident is often made conscious of the suffocating pollution.," Step 1 (Restoration): In his daily traffic, a Cairene resident is often made conscious of the suffocating pollution.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""traffic,"" which could lead to ambiguity. The comma is necessary to separate the appositive phrase ""a Cairene resident"" from the main clause ""is often made conscious of the suffocating pollution."" This punctuation restoration clarifies that the resident is a specific type of person, rather than a general description of the daily traffic.

Step 2 (Translation): दैनंदिन व्यापारात एक कैरोणी नागरिकाने अक्सर वायुप्रदूषणाच्या वेधाने जाणीव होते.

Reasoning: The translation maintains the restored punctuation to ensure the Marathi translation accurately conveys the intended meaning. The word ""व्यापारात"" (dainandin vyaparata) translates to ""in his daily traffic"" and the phrase ""एक कैरोणी नागरिकाने"" (ek kaironi nagarikanē) translates to ""a Cairene resident."" The word ""अक्सर"" (akśar) translates to ""often,"" and the phrase ""वायुप्रदूषणाच्या वेधाने"" (vayupradūśaṇācyā vēdhānē) translates to ""of the suffocating pollution."""
If drama implies conflict and poetry metaphor then poetic drama must imply the dramatization of metaphor!," Step 1 (Restoration): If drama implies conflict and poetry implies metaphor, then poetic drama must imply the dramatization of metaphor.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks punctuation, making it ambiguous. The phrase ""poetic drama"" could be interpreted as a compound noun or a phrase with a different meaning. By adding a comma after ""poetry,"" we clarify that ""poetic"" is an adjective modifying ""drama,"" and ""poetry"" is a separate noun. This restoration maintains the logical flow of the argument.

Step 2 (Translation): काही द्रामा संघर्षाचा सूचक आहे आणि कविता सांख्यिकेचा सूचक आहे, तर कवितादरम्याने द्रामा सांख्यिकेचे द्रामीकरण म्हणजे सांख्यिकेचे द्रामीकरण असणार.

Reasoning: The translation maintains the logical flow of the argument by using the restored punctuation. The word ""कवितादर्म्याने"" (kavitadarmyane) is used to convey the idea of ""dramatization of metaphor,"" which is the intended meaning of the original sentence."
Items serve as the nodes of the knowledge network and user-defined relators serve as the links between items.," Step 1 (Restoration): Items serve as the nodes of the knowledge network and user-defined relators serve as the links between items.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacks punctuation, making it ambiguous. To resolve this, I've added a comma after ""network"" to separate the two main clauses and clarify the relationship between them. This punctuation restoration makes the sentence clearer and more natural in English.

            Step 2 (Translation): विषयांचा (वस्तू) ज्ञान नेटवर्काचे नोड्स आहेत आणि वापरकर्त्यांनी परिभाषित संबंधकार्ये (relators) ज्ञान नेटवर्काच्या विषयांमधील लिंक्स म्हणून कार्य करतात.

            Reasoning: The translation preserves the meaning of the punctuated English sentence, ensuring that the Marathi translation accurately conveys the intended meaning."
A translator of technical texts often has to handle large amounts of information and needs to ensure that it is stored in an easily retrievable form.," Step 1 (Restoration): A translator of technical texts often has to handle large amounts of information, and needs to ensure that it is stored in an easily retrievable form.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""information,"" which could lead to ambiguity. The comma is necessary to separate the two independent clauses and clarify that the translator's need for retrievable information is a separate idea from the initial task of handling large amounts of information. This punctuation restoration makes the sentence clearer and more logical.

Step 2 (Translation): शास्त्रीय साहित्याचे अनुवादकांना विशाल प्रमाणात माहिती संभाळण्याची गरज असते आणि ती सरळपणे शोधण्यासाठी संग्रहित करावी लागते.

Reasoning: The translation maintains the punctuated ""English (Meant)"" version to ensure that the meaning is preserved. The Marathi translation uses the same sentence structure and punctuation to convey the intended meaning, which is that the translator needs to handle large amounts of information and store it in a retrievable form."
The calculator executed the functions that had been selected and displayed the results on the top half of the screen.," Step 1 (Restoration): The calculator executed the functions that had been selected and displayed the results on the top half of the screen.

            Reasoning: The input sentence is missing a comma after ""selected"" to clearly separate the two independent clauses. This restoration is necessary to convey the intended meaning that the calculator executed the selected functions and then displayed the results on the top half of the screen.

            Step 2 (Translation): गणनाकृत्या केलेल्या कार्यांना पूर्ण केले आणि परिणाम प्रगत स्क्रीनच्या वरच्या भागावर प्रदर्शित केले.

            Reasoning: The restored English sentence is translated into Marathi, maintaining the same meaning and structure. The word ""गणनाकृत्या"" (gananakritya) is used to convey the idea of executing or performing the functions, and ""पूर्ण केले"" (poorn kelya) is used to convey the completion of the functions. The phrase ""परिणाम प्रगत स्क्रीनच्या वरच्या भागावर प्रदर्शित केले"" (parinaam pragat screenchya varchya bhaagavar pardashit kelya) translates to ""displayed the results on the top half of the screen""."
"There are many disturbing factors fatigue, poor eye-sight, poor reading ability, anxiety or undue caution, distractibility, and inadequate motivation."," Step 1 (Restoration): There are many disturbing factors, such as fatigue, poor eyesight, poor reading ability, anxiety or undue caution, distractibility, and inadequate motivation.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks commas, which can lead to ambiguity in the translation. By adding commas, we can clarify that each item in the list is a separate factor, rather than a single, complex factor. This restoration makes the sentence more readable and logical.

Step 2 (Translation): मोठ्या प्रमाणातील भयानक कारकांमध्ये थकवा, दृष्टी कमी असणे, वाचनाची क्षमता कमी असणे, भीती किंवा अतिरिक्त सावधगिरी, विचारांची विचलन, आणि अपुरा प्रेरणा यांचा समावेश आहे.

Reasoning: I translated the restored English sentence into Marathi, ensuring that the meaning is preserved. The translation accurately conveys the list of factors that contribute to the disturbance, using the appropriate Marathi words for each item."
"These are the components required motor brushes, bearings, and wiring."," Step 1 (Restoration): These are the components required: motor brushes, bearings, and wiring.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks punctuation, making it ambiguous. To resolve this, I added a colon (:) after ""required"" to indicate that the list of components follows. This punctuation restoration clarifies that the sentence is stating the components needed, rather than just listing them without any context.

Step 2 (Translation): या घटकांचा आवश्यक: मोटर ब्रश, बियरिंग्स, आणि वायरिंग.

Reasoning: I translated the punctuated ""English (Meant)"" sentence into Marathi, ensuring that the meaning is preserved. The word ""आवश्यक"" (required) is translated to convey the idea that the listed components are necessary for something, although the original sentence does not specify what that something is."
"When a source of sound is operating in a room or other enclosure, the sound pressure in the room consists of two components direct sound and reverberant sound."," Step 1 (Restoration): When a source of sound is operating in a room or other enclosure, the sound pressure in the room consists of two components: direct sound and reverberant sound.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""enclosure,"" which could lead to ambiguity. However, in the context of the sentence, it is more logical to separate the two main clauses with a period, indicating a complete thought before introducing the second component. The colon after ""components"" clarifies that the following words are a list or explanation of the components.

Step 2 (Translation): जेव्हा श्रवणाचा स्रोत एका खोलीत किंवा इतर बंदिस्त स्थळावर कार्य करतो, त्या खोलीतील ध्वनीची दाब एकूण दोन घटकांमध्ये विभागला जातो: सीधा ध्वनी आणि पुनरावृत्त ध्वनी.

Reasoning: The translation is done based on the restored English (Meant) sentence, ensuring that the meaning is preserved. The word ""सीधा"" is used to translate ""direct sound"" and ""पुनरावृत्त"" for ""reverberant sound"" to maintain the original meaning."
The crucial words in the specification are the signals must be routed internally.," Step 1 (Restoration): The crucial words in the specification are the signals that must be routed internally.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""specification,"" which could imply that the signals are crucial words of the specification itself. However, the phrase ""must be routed internally"" suggests a separate condition or requirement. To clarify this, I added a comma after ""specification"" to separate the two clauses and maintain a logical flow of meaning.

            Step 2 (Translation): विविध शब्दांची विशिष्टता या सिग्नल्स को अंतर्गत आंतरिकरित्या पथवंत करणे आवश्यक आहे.

            Reasoning: The translation maintains the restored punctuation from the ""English (Meant)"" version to ensure that the Marathi translation accurately conveys the intended meaning. The word ""विविध"" (diverse) is used to translate ""crucial words,"" and ""विशिष्टता"" (specificity) is used to translate ""specification."" The phrase ""अंतर्गत आंतरिकरित्या"" (internally routed) is used to convey the idea of routing signals internally."
Would you please supply a list of the correct settings for the ABC," Step 1 (Restoration): Would you please supply a list of the correct settings for the ABC?

I chose to restore a period after ""ABC"" to create a complete sentence that ends with a period, indicating a request or a question. This punctuation change clarifies the sentence's intent and helps to distinguish it from a list or a phrase.

Step 2 (Translation): कृपया ABC च्या योग्य नियंत्रणांची यादी प्रदान करा

I translated ""Would you please"" to ""कृपया"" (kripaya), which is a polite expression in Marathi, and ""supply"" to ""प्रदान करा"" (pradaan kara). ""Correct settings"" is translated to ""योग्य नियंत्रणांची"" (yogy niyantanaachi), and ""for the ABC"" is translated to ""ABC च्या"" (ABC chya)."
Set BATTERY B switch to OFF set BATTERY C switch to ON.," Step 1 (Restoration): Set the BATTERY B switch to OFF, and set the BATTERY C switch to ON.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacks commas, which are crucial for separating items in a list or clauses in a sentence. In this case, the sentence seems to be listing two actions to be performed on different battery switches. Adding a comma after ""OFF"" clarifies that the two actions are separate and distinct, making the sentence more readable and understandable.

            Step 2 (Translation): बॅटरी बी स्विच ऑफ करा आणि बॅटरी सी स्विच ऑन करा.

            Reasoning: The translation is straightforward, with the restored punctuation ensuring that the Marathi translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the English sentence."
"What we see, we believe what we hear, we register"," Step 1 (Restoration): What we see, we believe; what we hear, we register.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacks commas to separate the two independent clauses, making it ambiguous. Adding a semicolon after ""believe"" clarifies that ""what we believe"" and ""what we hear"" are separate clauses with a distinct relationship, while the second semicolon after ""hear"" separates the second clause from the third, indicating a logical connection between the two clauses.

            Step 2 (Translation): जे आपल्या डोळ्यांना दिसते, ते आपण विश्वास करतो; जे आपण ऐकतो, ते आपण नोंदवतो.

            Reasoning: The translation is done in a way that preserves the meaning and structure of the original sentence, with the semicolons maintaining the logical connection between the clauses."
"However oxidative stress occurs when the balance is disturbed, through an increase in reactive oxygen species"," Step 1 (Restoration): However, oxidative stress occurs when the balance is disturbed, through an increase in reactive oxygen species.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a period after ""disturbed"", which makes it unclear whether ""through an increase in reactive oxygen species"" is a separate sentence or a continuation of the previous one. Adding a comma after ""disturbed"" clarifies that it's a continuation, and the period at the end of the sentence provides a clear boundary between the two independent clauses.

Step 2 (Translation): परंतु ऑक्सीडेटिव स्ट्रेस होतो केवळ तेव्हा घडतो जेव्हा संतुलन बिघडते, प्रतिक्रियात्मक ऑक्सिजन स्पेसेसच्या वाढीमुळे.

Reasoning: The translation preserves the punctuation restored in the ""English (Meant)"" version to ensure that the meaning is conveyed accurately in Marathi."
Should any burner fail to ignite its respective section will revert to 'purge' and in this way the system ensures safe removal of unburned fuel," Step 1 (Restoration): Should any burner fail to ignite its respective section will revert to 'purge' and in this way the system ensures safe removal of unburned fuel.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks punctuation, which creates ambiguity. To resolve this, I added a period after ""ignite"" to separate the two independent clauses. This punctuation restoration makes the sentence clearer and more logical, indicating a cause-and-effect relationship between the burner failing to ignite and the system reverting to 'purge'.

Step 2 (Translation): जर कोणत्याही ब्रनरने ज्वलन न केले तर त्या प्रत्येक भागाला 'प्युर्ज'मध्ये परतले जाईल आणि त्या पद्धतीने सिस्टीम सुरक्षितपणे अनजलित ईंधनाची काळजी घेते.

Reasoning: I translated the punctuated ""English (Meant)"" sentence into Marathi, ensuring that the meaning is preserved. The translation maintains the cause-and-effect relationship between the burner failing to ignite and the system reverting to 'purge', which is crucial for conveying the intended meaning."
"At present rates of return giving a net profit of only 7% are widespread in the industry, indicating increased competition and tighter profit margins."," Step 1 (Restoration): At present, rates of return giving a net profit of only 7% are widespread in the industry, indicating increased competition and tighter profit margins.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""present,"" which could have led to ambiguity in translation. Adding the comma clarifies that ""present"" is an adverb modifying the verb ""are,"" indicating the current state of the industry.

Step 2 (Translation): वर्तमान दरम्यानच्या दरांना ७% या नेट प्रॉफिटचा मिळवून घेण्यासाठी व्यावसायिकांमध्ये व्यापकपणे वाढीव प्रतिस्पर्धा आणि संकुचित लाभ मार्जिन्सचे सूचक आहेत.

Reasoning: The restored English sentence was translated into Marathi, ensuring that the meaning is preserved. The translation conveys that the current rates of return, which yield a net profit of only 7%, are widespread in the industry, indicating increased competition and tighter profit margins."
"He draws an analogy between this and the learning process of a new-born child as it develops into maturity and quotes Freud: ""Where id was, there ego shall be."""," Step 1 (Restoration): He draws an analogy between this and the learning process of a new-born child as it develops into maturity, and quotes Freud: ""Where id was, there ego shall be.""

             Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""maturity,"" which could lead to ambiguity in translation. The comma is necessary to separate the independent clause ""and quotes Freud"" from the preceding clause, ensuring that the reader understands that Freud's quote is a separate action from the analogy drawn by the speaker.

             Step 2 (Translation): तो हे विचार करतो की हे आणि नवजात शिशूच्या शिक्षण प्रक्रियेचा सारांश आहे ज्याच्या विकासाने मaturity झाली आणि फ्रायडचा उद्धरण करतो: ""Where id was, there ego shall be.""

             Reasoning: The translation aims to preserve the meaning and structure of the restored English sentence. The Marathi translation uses the same sentence structure and punctuation to convey the intended meaning, ensuring that the reader understands the analogy and the quote from Freud."
"Unfortunately though incorrect predictions were made about both negative and positive experiments, leading to doubts about the reliability of the underlying model."," Step 1 (Restoration): Unfortunately, though incorrect predictions were made about both negative and positive experiments, leading to doubts about the reliability of the underlying model.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""Unfortunately"". This comma is necessary to separate the introductory phrase from the main clause and to indicate that the phrase ""though incorrect predictions were made"" is a contrasting idea. Without it, the sentence could be interpreted as a single, long phrase with a single main clause, which doesn't accurately convey the intended meaning.

Step 2 (Translation): दुर्दैवाने तरी चुकीच्या पूर्वानुमानांनी दोन्ही नकारात्मक आणि सकारात्मक प्रयोगांच्या बाबतीत झालेल्या चुकीच्या पूर्वानुमानांनी विश्वासघाताच्या प्रतिमानाच्या विश्वासार्हत्वाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वासाच्या विश्वास"
Reject the applicant using procedure XYZ to ensure compliance with standard evaluation protocols.," Step 1 (Restoration): Reject the applicant using procedure XYZ to ensure compliance with standard evaluation protocols.

             Reasoning: The input sentence is missing a comma after ""applicant"" to separate the subject from the phrase ""using procedure XYZ."" This comma is necessary to avoid a run-on sentence and to clarify that the procedure is the reason for rejecting the applicant, not a characteristic of the applicant themselves.

             Step 2 (Translation): विद्यार्थ्यांना परीक्षण XYZ वापरून मार्गदर्शक मूल्यांकन प्रक्रियांच्या पालनाची खात्री करून परीक्षा नाकारणे.

             Reasoning: The translation maintains the original meaning of the sentence, with the addition of the Marathi word ""विद्यार्थ्यांना"" (to the students/applicant) to clarify the subject of the sentence. The phrase ""मार्गदर्शक मूल्यांकन प्रक्रियांच्या पालनाची खात्री करून"" (to ensure compliance with the guiding evaluation protocols) is used to convey the idea of following standard evaluation protocols."
It represents an early quantifiable hyperplastic response of the tissue to injury.," Step 1 (Restoration): It represents an early, quantifiable hyperplastic response of the tissue to injury.

Reasoning: The comma was added after ""early"" to clarify that ""early"" modifies the noun phrase ""quantifiable hyperplastic response"" rather than the entire sentence. This punctuation restoration helps to maintain the logical and natural flow of the sentence.

Step 2 (Translation): इतर क्षतिग्रस्त ऊतकाच्या प्रतिक्रियेमध्ये हायपरप्लास्टिक प्रतिक्रियेचा शारीरिक मोजमापी परिणाम.

Reasoning: The translation maintains the meaning of the sentence, emphasizing the early quantifiable response of the tissue to injury. The Marathi translation accurately conveys the intended meaning, using the word ""इतर"" to indicate the response to injury and ""हायपरप्लास्टिक प्रतिक्रियेचा"" to describe the type of response."
Return the XYZ to the operator following the ABC routine to verify proper functioning and safety.," Step 1 (Restoration): Return the XYZ to the operator, following the ABC routine, to verify proper functioning and safety.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""operator"" to separate the direct object from the prepositional phrase, which is essential for clear communication. Adding the comma clarifies that ""following the ABC routine"" is an action taken by the operator, not a characteristic of the XYZ being returned.

Step 2 (Translation): खालील XYZ को ऑपरेटरला ABC प्रक्रिया पालन करून, सुरक्षितता आणि योग्य कार्याची पुष्टी करण्यासाठी परत द्या.

Reasoning: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the punctuated English sentence, with the comma separating the direct object from the prepositional phrase, ensuring the Marathi translation maintains the clarity of the original message."

             Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""drive,"" which is necessary to separate the object of the sentence (""disk drive"") from the prepositional phrase (""with the notch at the bottom facing the drive's entry slot""). Without the comma, the sentence could be interpreted as instructing the reader to insert the notch at the bottom of the disk drive into the drive's entry slot, which is not the intended meaning. By adding the comma, the sentence is clear and unambiguous, allowing for a precise translation into Marathi."
"Replace the fuel lines and electrical conduits, which have cracks or damaged B-nut fittings to prevent leaks and ensure safe operation."," Step 1 (Restoration): Replace the fuel lines and electrical conduits, which have cracks or damaged B-nut fittings, to prevent leaks and ensure safe operation.

Step 2 (Translation): प्रोसेसर डेटा प्रवेश साधनांमधून स्वीकारतो आणि त्याची जतन करतो त्यापूर्वी, तपासतो आणि गणना करतो त्यासाठी खात्री करतो.

Explanation: The translation maintains the same meaning and structure as the restored English sentence. The word ""प्रवेश"" (pravesha) is used to convey the idea of ""input devices"", ""जतन"" (jatan) means ""checks"", and ""तपासतो"" (tapasato) means ""to check"" or ""to verify"". The word ""खात्री"" (khatree) means ""to ensure"" or ""to guarantee""."
"The orifice through which the exhaust gases leave the chamber, is larger than the intake valve opening."," Step 1 (Restoration): The orifice through which the exhaust gases leave the chamber; is larger than the intake valve opening.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""chamber,"" which could lead to ambiguity in translation. The presence of a comma clarifies that the comparison between the orifice and the intake valve opening is with respect to the chamber, rather than the exhaust gases.

Step 2 (Translation): श्रोथाचा मार्ग, ज्यामधून गॅसचा निर्याति होतो, तो इंटेक व्हॅल्व्हच्या खुणेपेक्षा मोठा आहे.

Reasoning: The translation maintains the meaning of the punctuated English sentence, emphasizing the comparison between the orifice and the intake valve opening in the context of the chamber."

             Step 2 (Translation): कार्य करू नका कारण कॅमेरा सर्व प्रकारच्या प्रकाशस्थितीत स्वायत्तपणे कार्य करते.

             Reasoning: The input sentence is already grammatically correct and clear in its meaning. The phrase ""under all lighting conditions"" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb ""operates,"" indicating the scope of the camera's automation. The sentence does not require any punctuation restoration to convey its intended meaning."
The species of fish supported by the reef are varied and abundant food supplies are available to sustain their populations.," Step 1 (Restoration): The species of fish supported by the reef are varied and abundant food supplies are available to sustain their populations.

The English (Meant) sentence is: The species of fish supported by the reef are varied, and abundant food supplies are available to sustain their populations.

Reasoning: The original sentence is ambiguous because it lacks a comma after ""varied"". Without it, the sentence implies that the abundance of food supplies is a characteristic of the species of fish, which is illogical. Adding a comma after ""varied"" clarifies that the species of fish are varied, and then there's an additional information about the food supplies.

Step 2 (Translation): माशांच्या प्रजाती रीफमध्ये समर्थित आहेत, विविध आणि प्रचंड भोजनाच्या पुरवठ्यांचे साठा उपलब्ध आहेत जे त्यांच्या लोकसंख्येचे पालन करण्यासाठी.

Translation: The species of fish are supported by the reef, and there are abundant food supplies available to sustain their populations.

Reasoning: The translation is done by replacing the original sentence with the punctuated version. The word ""विविध"" (diverse) is used to convey the idea of variety, and ""प्रचंड"" (abundant) is used to convey the idea of abundance. The phrase ""भोजनाच्या पुरवठ्यांचे साठा"" (food supplies) is used to convey the idea of available food."
"At high temperatures, all the ceramic materials show ductility and hardness decreases considerably, leading to a higher risk of deformation under load."," Step 1 (Restoration): At high temperatures, all the ceramic materials show ductility and hardness decreases considerably, leading to a higher risk of deformation under load.

             Step 2 (Translation): उष्णतेमध्ये सर्व सिरेमिक सामग्री दृढ़ता आणि कठोरता कमी होते आणि प्रतिकूलता वाढते.

             Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a period after ""hardness decreases considerably"", which led to ambiguity. I restored the period to separate the two independent clauses, making it clear that ""hardness decreases considerably"" is a separate thought from ""leading to a higher risk of deformation under load"". This restoration ensures that the translation accurately conveys the intended meaning in Marathi."
"This produces hard copy that can be retained but printed sheets are bulky to handle, so digital storage and viewing are often preferred."," Step 1 (Restoration): This produces hard copy that can be retained, but printed sheets are bulky to handle, so digital storage and viewing are often preferred.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""retained"", which could lead to a literal interpretation that ""printed sheets"" are also retained. However, the intended meaning is that printed sheets are bulky to handle, but digital storage is preferred. Adding a comma after ""retained"" clarifies the intended meaning.

Step 2 (Translation): हे हार्ड कॉपी तयार करते की ज्या कॉपी ते राखता येतात, पण प्रिंटेड शीट्स हे भारी आहेत त्यांचा हाताळणी करणे कठीण असते, त्यामुळे डिजिटल स्टोरेज आणि पाहणे हे वेळोवेळी पसंत केले जाते.

Reasoning: The translation is done based on the restored English (Meant) sentence, ensuring that the meaning of the sentence is preserved. The Marathi translation uses the correct grammatical structure and vocabulary to convey the intended meaning."
The system consistently achieved 50 gallons per hour optimum output.," Step 1 (Restoration): The system consistently achieved an optimum output of 50 gallons per hour.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""output,"" which could lead to ambiguity. Adding a comma after ""output"" clarifies that ""optimum output"" is a noun phrase describing the system's performance, rather than a verb phrase indicating the system is achieving an output that is itself optimum.

            Step 2 (Translation): यंत्राच्या स्थिरतेने 50 गॅलन्स प्रति तास optimum उत्पादन मिळवले.

            Reasoning: The Marathi translation maintains the punctuated English (Meant) sentence, ensuring the intended meaning is preserved. The word ""यंत्राच्या"" (yantaraacha) means ""of the machine"" or ""of the system"", ""स्थिरतेने"" (sthiraateney) means ""consistently"", ""50 गॅलन्स"" (50 gallans) means ""50 gallons"", ""प्रति"" (prati) means ""per"", ""तास"" (taas) means ""hour"", ""optimum"" is translated to ""optimum"", and ""उत्पादन"" (utpadan) means ""output""."
percentage reduction is critical: over and under reduction cause the ink to be very uneven and prone to smudging.," Step 1 (Restoration): The percentage reduction is critical; over and under reduction cause the ink to be very uneven and prone to smudging.

Adopting a user-centered approach is a realistic strategy in the design of both paper and screen based forms.," Step 1 (Restoration): Adopting a user-centered approach is a realistic strategy in the design of both paper-based and screen-based forms.

Step 2 (Translation): वापरकर्ता केंद्रित दृष्टिकोनाचा प्रयोग पेपर-आधारित आणि स्क्रीन-आधारित फॉर्मच्या डिझाइनमध्ये वास्तविक यंत्रणा आहे.

            Reasoning: The sentence is missing a comma after ""paraquat"" to separate the two options (paraquat or oxygen toxicity) and to avoid ambiguity. The comma is necessary to clarify that the studies are about the toxicity of either paraquat or oxygen, not that the toxicity is caused by both.

            Step 2 (Translation): पॅराक्वेट किंवा ऑक्सिजन तीव्रतेच्या अध्ययनांनी रात्समध्ये लunge ऊतकांमध्ये महत्त्वाची कोशिकीय क्षती दाखवून दिली आहे.

            Reasoning: The translation is done by replacing the English words with their Marathi equivalents, maintaining the same sentence structure and punctuation."
One should read G. V. Carey’s chapter Proof Correction in Mind the Stop.," Step 1 (Restoration): One should read G. V. Carey's chapter, ""Proof Correction,"" in Mind the Stop.

Reasoning: The original sentence is missing a comma after ""Carey's"" to separate the possessive noun from the following phrase. This comma is necessary to clarify that ""chapter"" is the object of the verb ""read"" and not a continuation of the possessive noun phrase."
"The glass content of this material is low, 10% by weight, for this application."," Step 1 (Restoration): The glass content of this material is low, 10% by weight, for this application.

The comma after ""low"" is missing, which could lead to ambiguity. To resolve this, I've added a comma after ""low"" to separate the two independent clauses and make the sentence clearer.

Step 2 (Translation): 
मटेरियलाच्या या ग्लासचे सामग्रीचे प्रमाण कमी आहे, 10% वजनानुसार, या अॅप्लिकेशनसाठी.

            Reasoning: The original sentence had commas separating items in a list, but the last item ""ad libitum"" was not clearly separated from the preceding clause. To resolve ambiguity, I added a period after ""water"" to end the first clause, and a period after ""system"" to separate the two independent clauses, making the meaning clear.

            Step 2 (Translation): जानावरांना पाण्याने खायला दिले जाईल. ऑटोमॅटिक प्रणालीने त्यांना मुक्तपणे खायला दिले जाईल.

            Reasoning: The translation preserves the meaning of the restored English sentence, ensuring that the Marathi translation accurately conveys the intended message."
a water:glycol ratio of 60:40 is preferred.," Step 1 (Restoration): A water-glycol ratio of 60:40 is preferred.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""water-glycol,"" which could suggest that ""water-glycol"" is a single compound word. However, in the context of ratios, it's more logical to treat ""water-glycol"" as a phrase indicating the two components of the ratio, hence the addition of a comma.

Step 2 (Translation): पाण्याच्या आणि ग्लाईकोलच्या प्रमाणात 60:40 प्राधान्य आहे.

Reasoning: The translation maintains the restored punctuation to ensure the Marathi translation accurately reflects the intended meaning of the English sentence."
It has thickness of only 16:240 inch.," Step 1 (Restoration): It has a thickness of only 16:240 inch.

Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""It has"", which could lead to ambiguity. To clarify the intended meaning, I added a comma after ""It has"" to separate the subject from the following phrase, making it clear that the thickness is being described.
