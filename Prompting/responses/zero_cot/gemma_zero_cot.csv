            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""businesses,"" leading to ambiguity.  The comma clarifies that ""which are or would be offensive"" modifies only ""small businesses,"" not the entire phrase ""Planning authorities should provide alternative locations."" This ensures the translation accurately reflects the intended meaning.

            Step 2 (Translation): मशीन विकसित होत असताना, आम्ही वापरतो आकडेवारी नोंदवण्यासाठीच्या फॉर्ममध्ये बदल केले जाईल.

            Reasoning: The original sentence was ambiguous because it wasn't clear if ""as the machine develops"" was a dependent clause modifying ""the forms"" or a separate statement. Adding a comma after ""develops"" clarifies that it's a dependent clause, making the sentence grammatically correct and conveying the intended meaning.

            Step 2 (Translation):

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""mentioned.""

            The comma separates the two independent clauses, showing that the second clause (""action cannot be taken in time"") is a consequence of the first clause (""Executors delay giving information...""). The period after ""this"" creates a stronger separation between the two clauses, emphasizing the cause-and-effect relationship.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""proteins."" This comma is crucial to separate the two clauses and clarify the relationship between the transfer of glycans and the resulting unoccupied sequons. Without the comma, the sentence could be interpreted as saying that the glycans are poorly transferred to proteins that are unoccupied glycosylation sequons, which is not the intended meaning.

            Step 2 (Translation):  कोणत्याही वृत्तपत्र, माझ्या विशेषज्ञ मतानुसार, पूर्णपणे निष्पक्ष नाही. 

            Reasoning:  The original sentence lacked a comma after ""newspaper"" and before ""in my expert opinion."" This comma is crucial because it clarifies that the opinion belongs to the speaker and is not a characteristic inherent to newspapers in general. Without the comma, the sentence could be misinterpreted as stating that newspapers themselves are unbiased, which is clearly not the intended meaning.

            *  Without commas, it's unclear if ""for that material"" modifies ""steam"" or ""acid.""
            *  Adding commas clarifies the intended meaning: ""Steam"" is being compared to ""acid"" in terms of damage to ""that material.""

            Step 2 (Translation): सर्वोत्तम प्रयत्नांमध्ये अपयश पावल्यानंतर, तो एक नवीन योजना आखला ज्याने सर्वजण आश्चर्यचकित केले.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""attempts"" which led to ambiguity.  It could be interpreted as ""He evolved a new plan which (was the result of) having failed in all previous attempts."" Adding the comma clarifies the relationship between the two clauses, making it clear that the plan was developed *because* of the previous failures. 


"

            Step 2 (Translation):  
            चित्रपट विकसित झाल्यावर, कोणत्याही फोटो समाधानकारक ठरले नाहीत.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacks a comma after ""developed.""  This comma is crucial because it separates the two clauses: 
            1. ""When the film was developed"" (a time-related clause)
            2. ""none of the pictures proved satisfactory"" (the main clause). 

            Without the comma, the sentence could be misinterpreted as saying that ""none of the pictures"" were the process of development, which is nonsensical. The comma clarifies the intended meaning, separating the two clauses and making the sentence grammatically correct and understandable. 


"

            Step 2 (Translation): जर नाट्य संघर्षाचा आणि कविता रूपकाचा अर्थ असेल, तर कवितात्मक नाट्य रूपकाचा अभिनय करतो असेच असेल!

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas to separate the two clauses joined by ""and.""

This punctuation restoration ensures the intended meaning is conveyed accurately in both English and Marathi.

            Reasoning: 
            The original sentence lacked a comma after ""present"" and before ""rates of return"". This comma is crucial because it separates the introductory phrase ""At present"" from the main clause. Without it, the sentence could be misinterpreted as saying that the rates of return themselves are ""at present"" which doesn't make sense. The comma clarifies the intended meaning, making it clear that the rates are prevalent at the current time.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas to separate the clauses and the quoted phrase.  Adding commas clarifies the structure: 

            *  It separates the main clause (""He draws an analogy..."") from the dependent clause (""as it develops into maturity"").

This punctuation change ensures the Marathi translation accurately reflects the intended meaning.

            Reasoning:

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""varied,"" which led to a run-on sentence.  Adding the comma separates the two independent clauses, clarifying that the reef supports varied fish species and that abundant food supplies are available separately. This punctuation aligns with the natural flow of the sentence and the intended meaning.

"At high temperatures, all the ceramic materials show ductility and hardness decreases considerably, leading to a higher risk of deformation under load.","Step 1 (Restoration): At high temperatures, all the ceramic materials show ductility, and hardness decreases considerably, leading to a higher risk of deformation under load. 

            Step 2 (Translation): उंच तापमानावर, सर्व सिरेमिक पदार्थ लवचिकता दाखवतात, आणि कठोरता खूप कमी होते, ज्यामुळे ताणावर वळणे होण्याची उच्च शक्यता असते.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas to separate the two clauses joined by ""and"".  Adding commas clarifies that ""ductility"" is a characteristic shown by the materials at high temperatures, while ""hardness decreases"" is a separate action. This punctuation ensures the Marathi translation accurately reflects the intended meaning.

"This produces hard copy that can be retained but printed sheets are bulky to handle, so digital storage and viewing are often preferred.","Step 1 (Restoration): This produces hard copy that can be retained, but printed sheets are bulky to handle, so digital storage and viewing are often preferred. 

            Step 2 (Translation):  हे प्रिंट केलेले कागदपत्रे मिळवून ठेवता येतात, पण प्रिंट केलेल्या पानकामांचे आकार मोठे असल्याने त्यांना हाताळणे कठीण असते, म्हणून डिजिटल संग्रहण आणि पाहणे अनेकदा प्राधान्य देण्यात येते.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas to separate the two clauses. Adding commas clarifies that ""but printed sheets are bulky to handle"" is a contrasting statement to ""This produces hard copy that can be retained"".  This punctuation ensures the Marathi translation accurately reflects the intended meaning of the comparison.

            Step 2 (Translation):  PTT पुरवठाद्वारे पाकेट-स्विच नेटवर्कशी जोडणे कार्यस्थळासाठी आणि या नेटवर्कांमध्ये प्रवेशद्वारे PTT च्या नियोजनाने सुसंगत डेटा संवाद सुनिश्चित करण्यात येईल.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""requirement,"" leading to ambiguity about whether ""gateways"" were a requirement or a separate element. Adding the comma clarifies that gateways are a separate plan by the PTTs. 


"

            Step 2 (Translation):  सिस्टमने स्थिरपणे तासाला ५० गॅलन, आदर्श उत्पादन मिळवले. 

            Reasoning:  The original sentence was ambiguous because it wasn't clear if ""optimum output"" was modifying ""50 gallons per hour"" or the entire system's achievement. Adding a comma after ""hour"" clarifies that the optimum output is 50 gallons per hour. 


"
percentage reduction is critical: over and under reduction cause the ink to be very uneven and prone to smudging.,"Step 1 (Restoration): Percentage reduction is critical; over and under reduction cause the ink to be very uneven and prone to smudging. 

            Step 2 (Translation):  
            प्रतशत कमीकरण महत्वाचे आहे; जास्त आणि कमी कमीकरण करून इंक खूप असमान आणि स्मजण्यास अडकणारी बनते.

            Reasoning: 
            The original sentence lacked a semicolon to separate the two independent clauses.  The semicolon is used here to create a clear pause and show that the two ideas are related but distinct. The comma after ""reduction"" is necessary to separate the items in the list ""over and under reduction.""

            Step 2 (Translation):  पराक्वाट किंवा ऑक्सिजन विषाणूच्या  मागेच्या प्राण्यांवरील मॉरफोलॉजिकल अभ्यासांनी फुफ्फुसांमध्ये लक्षणीय सेल्युलर नुकसान दर्शविले आहे.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a comma after ""paraquat"" to separate the two potential subjects of the sentence. Adding the comma clarifies that the studies are about paraquat *or* oxygen toxicity, not a combined entity.

            Step 2 (Translation): 
            एकाला जी. व्ही. केरी यांचा “प्रूफ कॅरेक्शन” हा अध्याय वाचायला हवा आहे *माइंड द स्टॉप* मध्ये.

            Reasoning: 
            The original sentence is ambiguous because it's unclear whether ""Proof Correction"" is the title of the chapter or a separate entity. Adding a comma after ""Carey’s chapter"" and enclosing ""Proof Correction"" in quotation marks clarifies that it is the chapter title.  The asterisk indicates that *Mind the Stop* is a book title.

"The glass content of this material is low, 10% by weight, for this application.","Step 1 (Restoration): The glass content of this material is low, 10% by weight; for this application. 

            Step 2 (Translation): या पदार्थाचा काँचचा प्रमाण कमी आहे, वजननुसार १०%; ही अॅप्लिकेशनसाठी.

            Reasoning: 
            The original sentence lacked a semicolon after ""weight"" which created ambiguity. It could be interpreted as saying the material's glass content is 10% by weight and that is low for the application. The semicolon clarifies that ""10% by weight"" is a specification and ""for this application"" is a separate statement.

"During the experiment, the animals will be fed with water, via an automatic system, ad libitum.","Step 1 (Restoration): During the experiment, the animals will be fed with water, via an automatic system, ad libitum. 

            Step 2 (Translation): प्रयोगात, प्राणी पाणी, स्वयंचलित प्रणालीद्वारे, अ‍ॅड लिबिटम देण्यात येतील.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked commas to separate the clauses and phrases, leading to potential ambiguity. Adding commas after ""experiment,"" ""water,"" and ""system"" clarifies the sentence structure and ensures a natural flow of information. 


"

            Step 2 (Translation):  वाटर:ग्लायकोल मिश्रणात ६०:४० अनुपात आवडते.

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked a space between ""water"" and "":"", and between "":glycol"" and ""ratio"".  Adding these spaces clarifies the intended meaning, making it clear that ""60:40"" refers to the ratio of water to glycol. 


"
It has thickness of only 16:240 inch.,"Step 1 (Restoration): It has a thickness of only 16:240 inch. 

            Step 2 (Translation): याची मोटाई फक्त १६:२४० इंच आहे. 

            Reasoning: The original sentence lacked an article (""a"") before ""thickness"" and a space between the numerical values. Adding these elements clarifies the meaning, making it clear that the thickness is a single value of 16:240 inches.
